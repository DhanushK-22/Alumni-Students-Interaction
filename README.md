# Alumni Association UI Project

This project is a UI design for an Alumni Association platform where current students can interact with their alumni. It is created using **Figma** and implements several key features such as queries, feeds, and separate sign-up/sign-in pages for both students and alumni.

## Features

- **Queries**: Students can send questions to alumni and receive responses.
- **Feeds**: A feed section where alumni and students can post updates or share insights.
- **Signup & Sign-in Pages**: Separate pages designed for both students and alumni to register and log in to the platform.
